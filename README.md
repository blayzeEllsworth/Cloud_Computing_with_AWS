# Cloud_Computing_with_AWS
Website I built from scratch (no use of templates) and launched on the cloud with AWS (currently deactivated)

The website is not currently active as I deleted the bins so I would not incur charges for AWS's services. I can reactivate upon request, but the website should perform the same as the code I have uploaded in this directory. I used Eclipse as my IDE, so the code is likely most optimal when uploaded to Eclipse.
