            <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <ul>
            	<li>Cloud computing offers IT resources using the Internet, otherwise known as holding space for "the Cloud", and it offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model. It saves money and space by getting rid of the need for owning and maintaining physical servers and data centers by lending computing power, storage, databases, and other things.</li>
           		<li>Businesses use cloud computing for various purposes such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, big data analytics, or online applications. </li>
            	<li>Some great Cloud Computing attributes are agility, elasticity, economic-efficiency, and global deployment. </li>
            	<li>The most common types of cloud computing services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). </li>
            	<li>Some of the more recent developments involve incorporation of AI or machine learning tools. </li>
            	<li>A common objective of Cloud Computing is to leverage Cloud migration to help organizations modernize applications and infrastructure. Some platforms even offer "intelligent recommendations" to accelerate digital transformation.</li>
